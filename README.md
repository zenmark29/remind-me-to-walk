# remind-me-to-walk

I created this little web page in reponse to this NPR broadcast: [Body Electric](https://www.npr.org/series/1199526213/body-electric target="_blank"). Because I'm on my laptop all day and in meetings I needed a prompt to get up. I concentrate so deeply that time will pass unnoticed to me. It was fun to create a little web page that I can keep up in the corner of a screen to remind me to get up every 25 minutes for 5 minutes. I added sound because the page is not always visible. I also like little web pages that don't need to know anything about me, don't track, don't ask questions, have nothing to sell, etc. So I make my own. You can access it via github here: [remind-me-to-walk](https://zenmark29.github.io/remind-me-to-walk/).
